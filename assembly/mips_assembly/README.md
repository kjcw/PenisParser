## Instructions

1. Download MARS from http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/

2. Put MARS in the same directory as penisparser.asm and your text file

3. Run terminal

4. cd to the directory where MARS and the assembly file are located

5. java -jar Mars4_5.jar penisparser.asm pa [your text file]

6. Enjoy

I've only tested this with MARS, so I can't guarantee that it's going to run on
SPIM. I tried compiling it with an actual MIPS machine but the terminal is
giving me some weird error. Will keep working on this to make sure that it runs
on every MIPS simulator/machine.
